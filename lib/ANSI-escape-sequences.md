# ANSI Escape Sequences

Standard escape codes are prefixed with `Escape`:

- Ctrl-Key: `^[`
- Octal: `\033`
- Unicode: `\u001b`
- Hexadecimal: `\x1B`
- Decimal: `27`

Followed by the command, somtimes delimited by opening square bracket (`[`), known as a Control Sequence Introducer (CSI), optionally followed by arguments and the command itself.

Arguments are delimeted by semi colon (`;`).

For example:

```sh
\x1b[1;31m  # Set style to bold, red foreground.
```

## Sequences

- `ESC` - sequence starting with `ESC` (`\x1B`)
- `CSI` - Control Sequence Introducer: sequence starting with `ESC [` or CSI (`\x9B`)
- `DCS` - Device Control String: sequence starting with `ESC P` or DCS (`\x90`)
- `OSC` - Operating System Command: sequence starting with `ESC ]` or OSC (`\x9D`)

Any whitespaces between sequences and arguments should be ignored. They are present for improved readability.

## General ASCII Codes

| Name  | decimal | octal | hex  | C-escape | Ctrl-Key | Description                    |
| ----- | ------- | ----- | ---- | -------- | -------- | ------------------------------ |
| `BEL` | 7       | 007   | 0x07 | `\a`     | `^G`     | Terminal bell                  |
| `BS`  | 8       | 010   | 0x08 | `\b`     | `^H`     | Backspace                      |
| `HT`  | 9       | 011   | 0x09 | `\t`     | `^I`     | Horizontal TAB                 |
| `LF`  | 10      | 012   | 0x0A | `\n`     | `^J`     | Linefeed (newline)             |
| `VT`  | 11      | 013   | 0x0B | `\v`     | `^K`     | Vertical TAB                   |
| `FF`  | 12      | 014   | 0x0C | `\f`     | `^L`     | Formfeed (also: New page `NP`) |
| `CR`  | 13      | 015   | 0x0D | `\r`     | `^M`     | Carriage return                |
| `ESC` | 27      | 033   | 0x1B | `\e`[*](#escape) | `^[` | Escape character           |
| `DEL` | 127     | 177   | 0x7F | `<none>` | `<none>` | Delete character               |

<div id="escape"></div>

> **Note:** Some control escape sequences, like `\e` for `ESC`, are not guaranteed to work in all languages and compilers. It is recommended to use the decimal, octal or hex representation as escape code.

  

> **Note:** The **Ctrl-Key** representation is simply associating the non-printable characters from ASCII code 1 with the printable (letter) characters from ASCII code 65 ("A"). ASCII code 1 would be `^A` (Ctrl-A), while ASCII code 7 (BEL) would be `^G` (Ctrl-G). This is a common representation (and input method) and historically comes from one of the VT series of terminals.

## Cursor Controls

> Hide cursor for 5 seconds
```shell
echo -e "\e[?25l" ; sleep 5 ; echo -e "\e[?25h"
```

| ESC Code Sequence                                  | Description                                              |
| :------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ESC[H`                                            | moves cursor to home position (0, 0)                     |
| `ESC[{line};{column}H` <br> `ESC[{line};{column}f` | moves cursor to line #, column #                         |
| `ESC[#A`                                           | moves cursor up # lines                                  |
| `ESC[#B`                                           | moves cursor down # lines                                |
| `ESC[#C`                                           | moves cursor right # columns                             |
| `ESC[#D`                                           | moves cursor left # columns                              |
| `ESC[#E`                                           | moves cursor to beginning of next line, # lines down     |
| `ESC[#F`                                           | moves cursor to beginning of previous line, # lines up   |
| `ESC[#G`                                           | moves cursor to column #                                 |
| `ESC[6n`                                           | request cursor position (reports as `ESC[#;#R`)          |
| `ESC M`                                            | moves cursor one line up, scrolling if needed            |
| `ESC 7`                                            | save cursor position (DEC)                               |
| `ESC 8`                                            | restores the cursor to the last saved position (DEC)     |
| `ESC[s`                                            | save cursor position (SCO)                               |
| `ESC[u`                                            | restores the cursor to the last saved position (SCO)     |

> **Note:** Some sequences, like saving and restoring cursors, are private sequences and are not standardized. While some terminal emulators (i.e. xterm and derived) support both SCO and DEC sequences, they are likely to have different functionality. It is therefore recommended to use DEC sequences.

## Erase Functions

| ESC Code Sequence | Description                               |
| :---------------- | :---------------------------------------- |
| `ESC[J`           | erase in display (same as ESC\[0J)        |
| `ESC[0J`          | erase from cursor until end of screen     |
| `ESC[1J`          | erase from cursor to beginning of screen  |
| `ESC[2J`          | erase entire screen                       |
| `ESC[3J`          | erase saved lines                         |
| `ESC[K`           | erase in line (same as ESC\[0K)           |
| `ESC[0K`          | erase from cursor to end of line          |
| `ESC[1K`          | erase start of line to the cursor         |
| `ESC[2K`          | erase the entire line                     |

> Note: Erasing the line won't move the cursor, meaning that the cursor will stay at the last position it was at before the line was erased. You can use `\r` after erasing the line, to return the cursor to the start of the current line.

## Colors / Graphics Mode

| ESC Code Sequence | Reset Sequence | Description                                                |
| :---------------- | :------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ESC[1;34;{...}m` |                | Set graphics modes for cell, separated by semicolon (`;`). |
| `ESC[0m`          |                | reset all modes (styles and colors)                        |
| `ESC[1m`          | `ESC[22m`      | set bold mode.                                             |
| `ESC[2m`          | `ESC[22m`      | set dim/faint mode.                                        |
| `ESC[3m`          | `ESC[23m`      | set italic mode.                                           |
| `ESC[4m`          | `ESC[24m`      | set underline mode.                                        |
| `ESC[5m`          | `ESC[25m`      | set blinking mode                                          |
| `ESC[7m`          | `ESC[27m`      | set inverse/reverse mode                                   |
| `ESC[8m`          | `ESC[28m`      | set hidden/invisible mode                                  |
| `ESC[9m`          | `ESC[29m`      | set strikethrough mode.                                    |

> **Note:** Some terminals may not support some of the graphic mode sequences listed above.

> **Note:** Both dim and bold modes are reset with the `ESC[22m` sequence. The `ESC[21m` sequence is a non-specified sequence for double underline mode and only work in some terminals and is reset with `ESC[24m`.

### Color codes

Most terminals support 8 and 16 colors, as well as 256 (8-bit) colors. These colors are set by the user, but have commonly defined meanings.

#### 8-16 Colors

| Color Name | Foreground Color Code | Background Color Code |
| :--------- | :-------------------- | :-------------------- |
| Black      | `30`                  | `40`                  |
| Red        | `31`                  | `41`                  |
| Green      | `32`                  | `42`                  |
| Yellow     | `33`                  | `43`                  |
| Blue       | `34`                  | `44`                  |
| Magenta    | `35`                  | `45`                  |
| Cyan       | `36`                  | `46`                  |
| White      | `37`                  | `47`                  |
| Default    | `39`                  | `49`                  |
| Reset      | `0`                   | `0`                   |

> **Note:** the _Reset_ color is the reset code that resets _all_ colors and text effects, Use _Default_ color to reset colors only.

Most terminals, apart from the basic set of 8 colors, also support the "bright" or "bold" colors. These have their own set of codes, mirroring the normal colors, but with an additional `;1` in their codes:

```sh
# Set style to bold, red foreground.
\x1b[1;31mHello
# Set style to dimmed white foreground with red background.
\x1b[2;37;41mWorld
```

Terminals that support the [aixterm specification](https://sites.ualberta.ca/dept/chemeng/AIX-43/share/man/info/C/a_doc_lib/cmds/aixcmds1/aixterm.htm) provides bright versions of the ISO colors, without the need to use the bold modifier:

| Color Name     | Foreground Color Code | Background Color Code |
| :------------- | :-------------------- | :-------------------- |
| Bright Black   | `90`                  | `100`                 |
| Bright Red     | `91`                  | `101`                 |
| Bright Green   | `92`                  | `102`                 |
| Bright Yellow  | `93`                  | `103`                 |
| Bright Blue    | `94`                  | `104`                 |
| Bright Magenta | `95`                  | `105`                 |
| Bright Cyan    | `96`                  | `106`                 |
| Bright White   | `97`                  | `107`                 |

#### 256 Colors

The following escape codes tells the terminal to use the given color ID:

| ESC Code Sequence | Description           |
| :---------------- | :-------------------- |
| `ESC[38;5;{ID}m` | Set foreground color. |
| `ESC[48;5;{ID}m` | Set background color. |

Where `{ID}` should be replaced with the color index from 0 to 255 of the following color table:

![256 Color table](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/995050/47952855-ecb12480-df75-11e8-89d4-ac26c50e80b9.png)

The table starts with the original 16 colors (0-15).

The proceeding 216 colors (16-231) or formed by a 3bpc RGB value offset by 16, packed into a single value.

The final 24 colors (232-255) are grayscale starting from a shade slighly lighter than black, ranging up to shade slightly darker than white.

Some emulators interpret these steps as linear increments (`256 / 24`) on all three channels, although some emulators may explicitly define these values.

#### RGB Colors

More modern terminals supports [Truecolor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_depth#True_color_.2824-bit.29) (24-bit RGB), which allows you to set foreground and background colors using RGB.

These escape sequences are usually not well documented.

| ESC Code Sequence       | Description                  |
| :---------------------- | :--------------------------- |
| `ESC[38;2;{r};{g};{b}m` | Set foreground color as RGB. |
| `ESC[48;2;{r};{g};{b}m` | Set background color as RGB. |

> Note that `;38` and `;48` corresponds to the 16 color sequence and is interpreted by the terminal to set the foreground and background color respectively. Where as `;2` and `;5` sets the color format.

## Screen Modes

### Set Mode

| `ESC[={value}l`   | Resets the mode by using the same values that Set Mode uses, except for 7, which disables line wrapping. The last character in this escape sequence is a lowercase L. |

### Common Private Modes

These are some examples of private modes, which are not defined by the specification, but are implemented in most terminals.

| ESC Code Sequence | Description                     |
| :---------------- | :------------------------------ |
| `ESC[?25l`        | make cursor invisible           |
| `ESC[?25h`        | make cursor visible             |
| `ESC[?47l`        | restore screen                  |
| `ESC[?47h`        | save screen                     |
| `ESC[?1049h`      | enables the alternative buffer  |
| `ESC[?1049l`      | disables the alternative buffer |

Refer to the [XTerm Control Sequences](https://invisible-island.net/xterm/ctlseqs/ctlseqs.html) for a more in-depth list of private modes defined by XTerm.

> Note: While these modes may be supported by the most terminals, some may not work in multiplexers like tmux.

### Keyboard Strings

```sh
ESC[{code};{string};{...}p
```

Redefines a keyboard key to a specified string.

The parameters for this escape sequence are defined as follows:

- `code` is one or more of the values listed in the following table. These values represent keyboard keys and key combinations. When using these values in a command, you must type the semicolons shown in this table in addition to the semicolons required by the escape sequence. The codes in parentheses are not available on some keyboards. `ANSI.SYS` will not interpret the codes in parentheses for those keyboards unless you specify the `/X` switch in the `DEVICE` command for `ANSI.SYS`.

- `string` is either the ASCII code for a single character or a string contained in quotation marks. For example, both 65 and "A" can be used to represent an uppercase A.

> **IMPORTANT:** Some of the values in the following table are not valid for all computers. Check your computer's documentation for values that are different.

[Control Characters](https://vt100.net/docs/vt100-ug/chapter3.html)

Control characters have values of 0008 - 0378, and 1778. The control characters recognized by the VT100 are shown in Table 3-10. All other control codes cause no action to be taken.

Control characters (codes 08 to 378 inclusive) are specifically excluded from the control sequence syntax, but may be embedded within a control sequence. Embedded control characters are executed as soon as they are encountered by the VT100. The processing of the control sequence then continues with the next character received. The exceptions are: if the character ESC occurs, the current control sequence is aborted, and a new one commences beginning with the ESC just received. If the character CAN (308) or the character SUB (328) occurs, the current control sequence is aborted. The ability to embed control characters allows the synchronization characters XON and XOFF to be interpreted properly without affecting the control sequence.
Table 3-10 Control Characters Control Character   Octal Code  Action Taken
NUL   000   Ignored on input (not stored in input buffer; see full duplex protocol).
ENQ   005   Transmit answerback message.

Control Sequences

The VT100 is an upward and downward software compatible terminal; that is, previous DIGITAL video terminals have DIGITAL private standards for control sequences. The American National Standards Institute (ANSI) has since standardized escape and control sequences in terminals in documents X3.41-1974 and X3.64-1977.

NOTE: The ANSI standards allow the manufacturer flexibility in implementing each function. This manual describes how the VT100 will respond to the implemented ANSI control function.

The VT100 is compatible with both the previous DIGITAL standard and ANSI standards. Customers may use existing DIGITAL software designed around the VT52 or new VT100 software. The VT100 has a “VT52 compatible” mode in which the VT100 responds to control sequences like a VT52. In this mode, most of the new VT100 features cannot be used.

Throughout this section of the manual, references will be made to “VT52 mode” or “ANSI mode.” These two terms are used to indicate the VT100’s software compatibility. All new software should be designed around the VT100 “ANSI mode.” Future DIGITAL video terminals will not necessarily be committed to VT52 compatibility.

Valid ANSI Mode Control Sequences
Definitions

The following listing defines the basic elements of the ANSI mode control sequences. A more complete listing appears in Appendix A.

Control Sequence Introducer (CSI)
    An escape sequence that provides supplementary controls and is itself a prefix affecting the interpretation of a limited number of contiguous characters. In the VT100 the CSI is ESC [.
    Parameter
    
            A string of zero or more decimal characters which represent a single value. Leading zeroes are ignored. The decimal characters have a range of 0 (608) to 9 (718).
                    The value so represented.
                    
                    Numeric Parameter
                        A parameter that represents a number, designated by Pn.
                        Selective Parameter
                            A parameter that selects a subfunction from a specified list of subfunctions, designated by Ps. In general, a control sequence with more than one selective parameter causes the same effect as several control sequences, each with one selective parameter, e.g., CSI Psa; Psb; Psc F is identical to CSI Psa F CSI Psb F CSI Psc F.
                            Parameter String
                                A string of parameters separated by a semicolon (738).
                                Default
                                    A function-dependent value that is assumed when no explicit value, or a value of 0, is specified.
                                    Final character
                                        A character whose bit combination terminates an escape or control sequence.
                                        
                                        Examples:

This sequence has two parameter values, the first specifying the line and the second specifying the column. The default condition with no parameters present, or parameters of 0, is equivalent to a cursor at home position.

If the parameter value is zero or one, the active position is moved one position to the left. If the parameter value is n, the active position is moved n positions to the left. If an attempt is made to move the cursor to the left of the left margin, the cursor stops at the left margin. Editor Function

The number of lines moved is determined by the parameter. If the parameter value is zero or one, the active position is moved one line downward. If the parameter value is n, the active position is moved n lines downward. In an attempt is made to move the cursor below the bottom margin, the cursor stops at the bottom margin. Editor Function

A parameter value of zero or one moves the active position one position to the right. A parameter value of n moves the active position n positions to the right. If an attempt is made to move the cursor to the right of the right margin, the cursor stops at the right margin. Editor Function
                                                                        CUP – Cursor Position

This sequence has two parameter values, the first specifying the line position and the second specifying the column position. A parameter value of zero or one for the first or second parameter moves the active position to the first line or column in the display, respectively. The default condition with no parameters present is equivalent to a cursor to home action. In the VT100, this control behaves identically with its format effector counterpart, HVP.

The number of lines moved is determined by the parameter. A parameter value of zero or one moves the active position one line upward. A parameter value of n moves the active position n lines upward. If an attempt is made to move the cursor above the top margin, the cursor stops at the top margin. Editor Function

                                                                                                                    This is a private parameter applicable to set mode (SM) and reset mode (RM) control sequences. The reset state causes only VT52 compatible escape sequences to be interpreted and executed. The set state causes only ANSI "compatible" escape and control sequences to be interpreted and executed.
                                                                                                                    DECARM – Auto Repeat Mode (DEC Private)
                                                                                                                    
                                                                                                                    This is a private parameter applicable to set mode (SM) and reset mode (RM) control sequences. The reset state causes no keyboard keys to auto-repeat. The set state causes certain keyboard keys to auto-repeat.
                                                                                                                    DECAWM – Autowrap Mode (DEC Private)
                                                                                                                    
                                                                                                                    This is a private parameter applicable to set mode (SM) and reset mode (RM) control sequences. The reset state causes any displayable characters received when the cursor is at the right margin to replace any previous characters there. The set state causes these characters to advance to the start of the next line, doing a scroll up if required and permitted.
                                                                                                                    DECCKM – Cursor Keys Mode (DEC Private)
                                                                                                                    
                                                                                                                    This is a private parameter applicable to set mode (SM) and reset mode (RM) control sequences. This mode is only effective when the terminal is in keypad application mode (see DECKPAM) and the ANSI/VT52 mode (DECANM) is set (see DECANM). Under these conditions, if the cursor key mode is reset, the four cursor function keys will send ANSI cursor control commands. If cursor key mode is set, the four cursor function keys will send application functions.
                                                                                                                    DECCOLM – Column Mode (DEC Private)

                                                                                                                    These sequences cause the line containing the active position to become the top or bottom half of a double-height double-width line. The sequences must be used in pairs on adjacent lines and the same character output must be sent to both lines to form full double-height characters. If the line was single-width single-height, all characters to the right of the center of the screen are lost. The cursor remains over the same character position unless it would be to the right of the right margin, in which case it is moved to the right margin.

This sequence will not be supported in future DEC terminals, therefore, DA should be used by any new software.
                                                                                                                    DECINLM – Interlace Mode (DEC Private)

The reset state (non-interlace) causes the video processor to display 240 scan lines per frame. The set state (interlace) causes the video processor to display 480 scan lines per frame. There is no increase in character resolution.

The reset state causes the origin to be at the upper-left character position on the screen. Line and column numbers are, therefore, independent of current margin settings. The cursor may be positioned outside the margins with a cursor position (CUP) or horizontal and vertical position (HVP) control.

Line and column numbers are therefore relative to the current margin settings. The cursor is not allowed to be positioned outside the margins.

The first parameter is the line number of the first line in the scrolling region; the second parameter is the line number of the bottom line in the scrolling region. Default is the entire screen (no margins). The minimum size of the scrolling region allowed is two lines, i.e., the top margin must be less than the bottom margin. The cursor is placed in the home position (see Origin Mode DECOM).

This sequence has two parameter values, the first specifying the line position and the second specifying the column. A parameter value of either zero or one causes the active position to move to the first line or column in the display, respectively. The default condition with no parameters present moves the active position to the home position. In the VT100, this control behaves identically with its editor function counterpart, CUP. The numbering of lines and columns depends on the reset or set state of the origin mode (DECOM). Format Effector

The reset state causes the interpretation of the line feed (LF), defined in ANSI Standard X3.4-1977, to imply only vertical movement of the active position and causes the RETURN key (CR) to send the single code CR. The set state causes the LF to imply movement to the first position of the following line and causes the RETURN key to send the two codes (CR, LF). This is the New Line (NL) option.
